<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>

<li>4 SERVINGS</li>
<li>2 cups arepa flour (precooked cornmeal)</li>
<li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
<li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>

</ul>
<div class= "other">

<h2>Preparation</h2>
<div class= "prep">
<p>Combine arepa flour and salt in a medium bowl. Make a well in the center and add 2½ cups warm water. 
    Using a wooden spoon, gradually incorporate dry ingredients, stirring 
    until no dry lumps remain.
 Let rest 5 minutes to hydrate.
Knead dough a few times in bowl, then divide into 8 pieces. Roll each piece on work surface into a ball, 
then gently flatten to about ½” thick.
Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add 4 arepas, cover, and cook until 
golden brown, 6–8 minutes. Uncover, flip, and cook (keep uncovered) until other side is golden brown,
 6–8 minutes. Transfer arepas to a wire rack. Repeat with remaining 1 Tbsp. oil and dough.
Split arepas and stuff with desired fillings; serve with lime wedges for squeezing over.</p>
